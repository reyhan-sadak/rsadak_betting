### **Idea!**
Site for football match *predictions* and *betting*. The moderator creates **football leagues**. Every league consists of **football teams**.
The administrator or moderator could create **group of matches**. Then he adds **matches** to this group.

Every user could make **prediction** what the final score of the game will be. For every correct exact result, the user gets 3 points. If only the winner(or draw) is correct, the user gets 1 point. There is ranking for each group. The moderator takes care of updating the played games results. The purpose is friends to play and enjoy. If they want, they could bet some money.

A registered user will be able to view the predictions of the other users.

### Technology
The project uses **MySql** database. The scripts are written in **PHP**, the used version is 5.4. **CSS** is used for styles and **JavaScript** is used for making it more dynamic.
#### Used frameworks
[**Medoo**][medoo] - framework for easier work with MySql.

[**jQuery**][jquery] - a well known JavaScript library

You can visit the [site][id] and make prediction.
